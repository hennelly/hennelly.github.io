**Hello!**

My name is Lauren Hennelly and I'm a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow in the Globe Institute at University of Copenhagen. I recently finished my Ph.D in the [Mammalian Ecology and Conservation Unit](https://mecu.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis. 

I use genomic tools to study the evolution and ecology of various species. Much of my research is centered on understanding the evolutionary and ecological processes that impact genomic variation across populations and between species. I also have a strong interest in studying behavioral ecology and how behavior varies across different populations. Through this research, I work with various collaborators to provide important information to guide conservation management and help create effective conservation programs for various species.

My **postdoctoral research** investigates the ecological and evolutionary processes that underlie local adaptation in a wild mammal, the gray wolf. This research is multidisplinary and combines genomic technologies, ecological/environmental data, and phenotypic measures to investigate mechanisms that generate and facilitate local adaptation in gray wolves. 

My **Ph.D research** used whole genome data to study the evolutionary history of gray wolves. For this research, I used various field-based, genomic, and computational methods as well as collaborate with a wide range of researchers to answer questions on gray wolves. A strong component of this research was focused on gray wolves in South Asia and involved collaboration with various governmental organizations, universities, and NGOs in India and Pakistan. With newly sequenced gray wolf genomes generated from my Ph.D work, I investigated patterns of divergence, demographic history, and gene flow across wolf populations in Asia.

  Originally from Illinois, I obtained my B.S. in Evolutionary Biology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After graduating, I worked various field positions in the Indian Himalaya, Australia, and New Zealand. In 2014, I became a <a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/">Fulbright</a> scholar affiliated with the <a href="http://www.wii.gov.in">Wildlife Institute of India</a> to studying Himalayan and Indian wolf behavior.

  Before starting my Ph.D at University of California, Davis, I was a research technician with the Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and a Project Biologist for the <a href="https://www.woodriverwolfproject.org/">Wood River Wolf Project</a> based in Idaho. Recently, I've joined the <a href="https://www.canids.org/">IUCN Canid Specialist Group</a> to help translate my research into policy and conservation. In my freetime, I enjoy spending time outdoors -- whether hiking, camping, or observing wildlife.

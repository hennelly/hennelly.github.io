Hello! My name is Lauren Hennelly and I'm a Ph.D Candidate in the Mammalian Ecology and Conservation Unit at the University of California, Davis. I'm broadly interested in studying the proccesses that influence patterns in genomic variation across populations and between species. Through this research, I hope to provide important information ot guide conservation management and help create effective conservation programs for various species.

Originally from Illinois, I obtained my B.S. in Evolutionary Biology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After graduating I worked various field positions in the Indian Himalaya, Australia, and New Zealand. In 2014, I became a Fulbright scholar affiliated with the Wildlife Institute of India to studying Himalayan and Indian wolf behavior. Before starting my Ph.D at University of California, Davis, I was a research technician with the Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and a Project Biologist for the Wood River Wolf Project based in Idaho.

**Hello!**

My name is Lauren Hennelly and I'm a Ph.D Candidate in the [Mammalian Ecology and Conservation Unit](https://mecu.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis.

I'm broadly interested in studying the processes that influence patterns in genomic variation across populations and between species. I also have a strong interest in studying the behavior, ecology and evolution of mammals. Through this research, I hope to provide important information to guide conservation management and help create effective conservation programs for various species.

My current thesis research is broadly on the genomic history of wolf-like canids in Africa and Asia.

Originally from Illinois, I obtained my B.S. in Evolutionary Biology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After graduating, I worked various field positions in the Indian Himalaya, Australia, and New Zealand. In 2014, I became a [Fulbright](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) scholar affiliated with the [Wildlife Institute of India](http://www.wii.gov.in) to studying Himalayan and Indian wolf behavior. Before starting my Ph.D at University of California, Davis, I was a research technician with the Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and a Project Biologist for the [Wood River Wolf Project](https://www.woodriverwolfproject.org/) based in Idaho. I also enjoy natural history and working collaboratively on research projects.

**Hello!**

My name is Lauren Hennelly and I'm currently a Ph.D Candidate in the [Mammalian Ecology and Conservation Unit](https://mecu.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis. I will be starting as a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at University of Copenhagen in the Fall of 2022.

I use genomic data to study the evolution and ecology of various species, with a focus on mammals. Much of my research is centered on understanding the evolutionary processes that impact genomic variation across populations and between species. I also have a strong interest in studying how behavior varies across different populations. Through this research, I hope to provide important information to guide conservation management and help create effective conservation programs for various species.

My current thesis research is broadly on using whole genome data to study the evolutionary history of gray wolves. For this, I use various field-based, genomic, and computational methods as well as collaborate with a wide range of researchers to answer questions on gray wolves. With newly sequenced gray wolf genomes, we are investigating patterns of divergence, demographic history, and gene flow across wolf populations in Asia. 

- A strong component of this research is focused on **gray wolves in South Asia** and involves collaboration with various government organizations, universities, and NGOs in Pakistan and India.

  Originally from Illinois, I obtained my B.S. in Evolutionary Biology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After graduating, I worked various field positions in the Indian Himalaya, Australia, and New Zealand. In 2014, I became a <a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/">Fulbright</a> scholar affiliated with the <a href="http://www.wii.gov.in">Wildlife Institute of India</a> to studying Himalayan and Indian wolf behavior.

  Before starting my Ph.D at University of California, Davis, I was a research technician with the Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and a Project Biologist for the <a href="https://www.woodriverwolfproject.org/">Wood River Wolf Project</a> based in Idaho. Recently, I've joined the <a href="https://www.canids.org/">IUCN Canid Specialist Group</a> to help translate my research into policy and conservation. In my freetime, I enjoy spending time outdoors -- whether hiking, camping, or observing wildlife.

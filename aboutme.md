**Hello!**

My name is Lauren Hennelly and I'm a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow in the Globe Institute at University of Copenhagen. I recently finished my Ph.D in the [Mammalian Ecology and Conservation Unit](https://mecu.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis. 

I use genomic tools to study the evolution and ecology of various species. Much of my research is centered on understanding the evolutionary and ecological processes that impact genomic variation across populations and between species. I also have a strong interest in studying behavioral ecology and how behavior varies across different populations. Through this research, I work with various collaborators to provide important information to guide conservation management and help create effective conservation programs for various species. 

My work has mainly involved studying gray wolves and other canid species. Recently, I've joined the <a href="https://www.canids.org/">IUCN Canid Specialist Group</a> to help translate my research into policy and conservation

  Originally from Illinois, I obtained my B.S. in Evolutionary Biology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After graduating, I worked various field positions in the Indian Himalaya, Australia, and New Zealand. In 2014, I became a <a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/">Fulbright</a> scholar affiliated with the <a href="http://www.wii.gov.in">Wildlife Institute of India</a> to studying Himalayan and Indian wolf behavior.

  Before starting my Ph.D at University of California, Davis, I was a research technician with the Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and a Project Biologist for the <a href="https://www.woodriverwolfproject.org/">Wood River Wolf Project</a> based in Idaho. In my freetime, I enjoy spending time outdoors -- whether hiking, camping, or observing wildlife.

I thought I would share some information about obtaining research experience, grants, and graduate school tips that might be helpful below.

### Getting experience in the research

- At many universities and colleges, professors that teach classes often have a research lab full of graduate students and other scientists. These labs sometimes have opportunities for undergraduates to get involved with research. If you find a certain professor or graduate student's research interesting and would like to get involved, you could consider emailing them to see if there are any research opportunities in their lab.   

  - For **UC Davis undergrads** there is a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1sk-_PiYOKjV3f4sIWQuMLhef8JQiHRh8mgInhH_wAD4/edit?ouid=113616721582252285383&usp=sheets_home&ths=true) that has undergraduate research/field work opportunities to work with graduate students on a wide range of projects (wildlife, entomology, soil science, agriculture, etc)

- [Research Experiences for Undergraduates](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.jsp?unitid=5047) : this program funded by the National Science Foundation provides fully funded, amazing opportunities to work with scientists and conduct research in the summer months. 

- [Texas A&M Job Board](https://wfscjobs.tamu.edu/job-board/) : this webpage posts various wildlife-related jobs, including short-term positions over the summer months. Becoming a field technician is a great way to gain on-the-ground fieldwork experience and spend time learning about wildlife biology outside of the classroom! 

- Many large natural history museums offer both paid and unpaid internships to work with scientists on various projects. Here's a few links of internships by various museums: 

  - Opportunities at the [National Museum of Natural History](https://www.smithsonianofi.com/internship-opportunities/) in Washington DC
  - Opportunities at the [Field Musuem of Natural History Museum](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/careers/internships) in Chicago
  - Summer Systematics Institute Internship at the [California Academy of Sciences](https://www.calacademy.org/summer-systematics-institute)
  

- If you've recieved a Federal Pell Grant from the U.S Government, you could be eligible for the [Bejamin A. Gilman International Scholarship](https://www.gilmanscholarship.org/program/eligibility/), which financially supports undergraduates at 4 and 2 year colleges to study abroad. I've seen some students incorporate wildlife research internships into their study abroad experience (this [student](https://www.gilmanscholarship.org/2019/02/18/gilman-scholars-independent-study-in-madagascar/) did an wildlife internship in Madagascar)

- Here's a [list of organizations and job boards](https://www.jennie-miller.com/uploads/5/8/7/0/5870991/conservation_career_resources.pdf) compiled by Dr. Jennie Miller (Defenders of Wildlife) that also might be useful. 
### Grants for Wildlife Research 

Here's a list of a few grants and fellowship opportunities 

- [The Fulbright Program](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) offers fellowships for U.S based individuals to conduct research abroad **AND** individuals based in other countries to conduct research in the United States. The mission of the Fulbright program is to foster mutual understanding among nations and share knowledge across communities through educational and cultural exchange.

  - For the Research Awards, applicants can design a research project in collaboration with an organization based abroad (or a US-based organization/university if applying from abroad). I did a Fulbright in 2014 to study wolves in India -- if anyone has any questions about the application process, I'm happy to answer questions over email. 
  
  - **For Pakistani scholars**: Pakistan has one of the largest Fulbright program and offers a wide range of fellowship types (grants for funding graduate degrees, undergraduate and teacher exchange programs, etc). Check out the [United States Educational Foundation in Pakistan](https://www.usefpakistan.org/ProgramsHome.cfm?Tab=Programs)'s website for more information. 

- [The Rufford Foundation Grant](https://www.rufford.org/rsg/) : this grant is aimed for providing funding for conservationists working in developing countries. 

- [The Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund](https://www.speciesconservation.org/) : this organization provides grants to individual species conservation initiatives, mostly focused on species that are endangered or threatened.

- [The Alongside Wildlife Foundation](https://alongsidewildlifefoundation.org/): This NGO helps fund projects that are important yet typically overlooked by most funding agencies and organizations. Some of these often overlooked areas include projects that generate basic but fundamental information about species and projects involving science communciation. 

- **for scholars based not in USA:** [SCGIS International Scholarship Program](https://www.scgis.org/content/training/international-scholarship-program) is designed to allow conservation GIS practitioners to attend the Esri User Conference and SCGIS Annual Conference in California, as well as allow them to take specialized three-week GIS courses at University of California, Davis!

- **for scholars based not in USA:** [Conservation Leadership Programme](http://www.conservationleadershipprogramme.org/): this organization supports early career conservationists with project funding, as well as training and network opportunities. 

- **for scholars based not in USA:** [IDEA WILD](http://www.ideawild.org/) is a great NGO that aims to empower conservationists by awarding equipment grants for projects focused on research, conservation education, field training, etc. For example, IDEA WILD provides equipment such as camera traps, spotting scopes, tents, binoculars, GPS units to conservation projects worldwide. 

### APPLYING TO GRADUATE SCHOOL

The process of applying to an Ecology/Evolution/Conservation graduate program in the U.S.A can be a bit confusing. The process is not as straight foward as just writing applications and taking the GRE. 

The advice from [Dr. Jennie Miller](https://www.jennie-miller.com/) provides a great overview on the application process and is tailored for **international students** that may not be familar with the typical procedures of applying to U.S. schools. You can find the pdf [here](http://www.jennie-miller.com/uploads/5/8/7/0/5870991/jennies_tips_on_how_to_apply_to_grad_school.pdf). 

Dr. Anusha Shankar also provides [tips](http://anushashankar.weebly.com/grad-school-advice.html) on applying to graduate school. 

The Brashares Group at University of California-Berkeley also offers [advice](https://nature.berkeley.edu/BrasharesGroup/advice/) for applying to a graduate program in ecology/evolution/conservation.

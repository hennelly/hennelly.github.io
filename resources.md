About research opportunities 

I was raised in a small town on the Illinois-Wisconsin border and was lucky to have a family that encouraged me to follow whatever I was passionate about. With no one in my immediate and extended family involved in a STEM field or obtaining a post-undergraduate degree, I found the process of how to find opportunities in science, applying to graduate school, and how to fund research difficult to navigate. I've been lucky to have had wonderful mentors during my undergrad at UW Madison that have helped guide me on the path of becoming a scientist.   

I thought I would share some information that might be helpful: 

#### Getting experience in the research

- At many universities and colleges, professors that teach classes often have a lab of graduate students doing research. These labs sometimes have opportunities for undergraduates to get involved with research, which is an excellent way to experience the process of research. If you find a certain professor or graduate student's research interesting and would like to get involved, you could consider emailing them to see if there are any research opportunities in their lab.   

- [Research Experiences for Undergraduates](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.jsp?unitid=5047) : this program funded by the National Science Foundation provides fully funded, amazing opportunities to work with scientists and conduct research in the summer months. 

- [Texas A&M Job Board](https://wfscjobs.tamu.edu/job-board/) : this webpage posts various wildlife-related jobs, including short-term positions over the summer months. Becoming a field technician is a great way to gain on-the-ground fieldwork experience and spend time learning about wildlife biology outside of the classroom! 

- Many large natural history museums offer both paid and unpaid internships to work with scientists on various projects. Here's a few links of internships by various museums: 
  - Opportunities at the [National Museum of Natural History](https://www.smithsonianofi.com/internship-opportunities/) in Washington DC
  - Opportunities at the [Field Musuem of Natural History Museum](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/careers/internships) in Chicago
  - Summer Systematics Institute Internship at the [California Academy of Sciences](https://www.calacademy.org/summer-systematics-institute)
  
- If you've recieved a Federal Pell Grant from the U.S Government, you could be eligible for the [Bejamin A. Gilman International Scholarship](https://www.gilmanscholarship.org/program/eligibility/), which finiacially supports undergraduates at 4 and 2 year colleges to study abroad. I've seen some students incorporate wildlife research internships into their study abroad experience (this [student](https://www.gilmanscholarship.org/2019/02/18/gilman-scholars-independent-study-in-madagascar/) did an wildlife internship in Madagascar)

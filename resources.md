I was raised in a small town on the Illinois-Wisconsin border and was lucky to have a family that encouraged me to follow whatever I was passionate about. With no one in my immediate and extended family involved in a STEM field or obtaining a post-undergraduate degree, I found the process of how to find opportunities in science, applying to graduate school, and how to fund research difficult to navigate. I've been lucky to have had wonderful mentors during my undergrad at UW Madison that have helped guide me on the path of becoming a scientist.   

I thought I would share some information that might be helpful below. This information is aimed at U.S. based undergraduates and graduate students working abroad (such as in Pakistan and India): 

### Getting experience in the research

- At many universities and colleges, professors that teach classes often have a lab of graduate students doing research. These labs sometimes have opportunities for undergraduates to get involved with research, which is an excellent way to experience the process of research. If you find a certain professor or graduate student's research interesting and would like to get involved, you could consider emailing them to see if there are any research opportunities in their lab.   

  - For **UC Davis undergrads** there is a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1sk-_PiYOKjV3f4sIWQuMLhef8JQiHRh8mgInhH_wAD4/edit?ouid=113616721582252285383&usp=sheets_home&ths=true) that has undergraduate research/field work opportunities to work with graduate students on a wide range of projects (wildlife, entomology, soil science, agriculture, etc)

- [Research Experiences for Undergraduates](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.jsp?unitid=5047) : this program funded by the National Science Foundation provides fully funded, amazing opportunities to work with scientists and conduct research in the summer months. 

- [Texas A&M Job Board](https://wfscjobs.tamu.edu/job-board/) : this webpage posts various wildlife-related jobs, including short-term positions over the summer months. Becoming a field technician is a great way to gain on-the-ground fieldwork experience and spend time learning about wildlife biology outside of the classroom! 

- Many large natural history museums offer both paid and unpaid internships to work with scientists on various projects. Here's a few links of internships by various museums: 

  - Opportunities at the [National Museum of Natural History](https://www.smithsonianofi.com/internship-opportunities/) in Washington DC
  - Opportunities at the [Field Musuem of Natural History Museum](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/careers/internships) in Chicago
  - Summer Systematics Institute Internship at the [California Academy of Sciences](https://www.calacademy.org/summer-systematics-institute)
  

- If you've recieved a Federal Pell Grant from the U.S Government, you could be eligible for the [Bejamin A. Gilman International Scholarship](https://www.gilmanscholarship.org/program/eligibility/), which finiacially supports undergraduates at 4 and 2 year colleges to study abroad. I've seen some students incorporate wildlife research internships into their study abroad experience (this [student](https://www.gilmanscholarship.org/2019/02/18/gilman-scholars-independent-study-in-madagascar/) did an wildlife internship in Madagascar)

### Grants for Wildlife Research 

Here's a list of a few grants and fellowship opportunities 

- [The Fulbright Program](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) offers fellowships for U.S based individuals to conduct research abroad **AND** individuals based in other countries to conduct research in the United States. The mission of the Fulbright program is to foster mutual understanding among nations and share knowledge across communities through educational and cultural exchange.

  - For the Research Awards, applicants can design a research project in collaboration with an organization based abroad. I did a Fulbright in 2014 to study wolves in India -- if anyone has any questions about the application process, I'm happy to answer questions over email. 
  
  - **For Pakistani scholars**: Pakistan has one of the largest Fulbright program and offers a wide range of fellowship types (grants for funding graduate degrees, undergraduate and teacher exchange programs, etc). Check out the [United States Educational Foundation in Pakistan](https://www.usefpakistan.org/ProgramsHome.cfm?Tab=Programs)'s website for more information. 

- [The Rufford Foundation Grant](https://www.rufford.org/rsg/) : this grant is aimed for providing funding for conservationists working in developing countries. 

- [The Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund](https://www.speciesconservation.org/) : this organization provides grants to individual species conservation initiatives, mostly focused on species that are endangered or threatened.

Below are a couple of fun talks I have given about my research to various audiences. Enjoy! 

**Webinar at the Wolf Conservation Center**

This last fall I gave a webinar on our work of unraveling the evolutionary history of wolves in South and Central Asia. Here I talk about our recent findings on sequencing the first whole genomes of Indian wolves, where we found they represent the world's most ancient surviving wolf lineage.

**Instagram Live Session with The Grasslands Trust**

I had a fun conversation all about Indian wolves with The Grasslands Trust in India, which is a NGO working towards conserving wildlife found in the grasslands and scrublands of India. They do great work to protect these endangered grassland habitats through research activities and awareness.

**Webinar at University of Okara in Punjab, Pakistan**

In the winter of 2022 I gave a webinar over Zoom about our gray wolf research at the University of Okara in Pakistan. This webinar was organized by Dr. Hira Fatima who had previously spent 6 months in our lab at UC Davis in the Fall of 2018. It was a lot of fun to share our research and answer questions from students.

**Research**

My research revolves around understanding the evolutionary processes that shape genomic diversity of species and between their populations. For this, I use genomic tools, computational methods, and collaborate with a wide range of researchers to answer questions on the evolution and ecology of species, focused on mammals. I am invested in ensuring that the scientific knowledge generated from this research is applied to conservation. 

**Gray wolves of South and Central Asia**

My Ph.D thesis focuses on using genomics to further our knowledge on the evolutionary history of gray wolves in Asia. Gray wolves are comprised of three major mitochondrial lineages. Most gray wolves occuring from Europe to North America share recent (<100kya) maternal origins, and correspond to a Holarctic clade. The Tibetan and Indian mitochondrial lineages are deeply divergent (200-700kya) and geographicallly restricted, respectively, to the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan plateau. This far, no genome-wide analyses have included wolves corresponding to the mitochondrial Indian clade, and therefore it is unknown whether these wolves are genomically distinct. In 2003, Indian wolves were thought to number around 2,000 to 3,000 individuals in india and an unknown number of individuals in a declining population in Pakistan. Therefore, this genomic work has significant conservation implications for conserving the remaining Indian wolf populations. To address some of these questions, I have been collaborating with the Wildlife Institute of India for the last 7 years and starting collaborations in Pakistan over the last 3 years to investigate the genomic distinctiveness, evolutionary history, and ecology of wolves in Central and South Asia. 

More broadly, gray wolves in Asia provide a system to study the processes influencing whether and how lineage boundaries between highly mobile, yet genomically distinct populations are maintained. However, deciphering th evolutionary history of distinctive, yet interfertile lineages is particularly challenging. Emerging Disentangling signals of the historical branching pattern, gene flow between lineages, and stochastic assorting of ancestral alleles (incomplete lineage sorting) of recently diverged lineages is particularly challenging.

**Research**

My research revolves around understanding the evolutionary processes that shape genomic diversity of species and between their populations. In particular, I am interested in the processes influencing whether and how lineage boundaries between highly mobile, yet genomically dinstinct populations are maintained. For this, I use genomic tools, computational methods, and collaborate with a wide range of researchers to answer questions on the evolution and ecology of mammalian species. I am invested in ensuring that the scientific knowledge generated from this research is applied to conservation. 

**Gray wolves of South and Central Asia**

My Ph.D thesis focuses on using genomics to further our knowledge on the evolutionary history of gray wolves in Asia. Gray wolves

For my research, I used rates of recombination to aid in distinguishing between introgression, incomplete lineage sorting, and the original species branching pattern.

My research revolves around understanding the evolutionary processes that shape genomic diversity of species and between their populations. For this, I use genomic tools, computational methods, and collaborate with a wide range of researchers to answer questions on the evolution and ecology of species, focused on mammals. I am invested in ensuring that the scientific knowledge generated from this research is applied to conservation. 


**GRAY WOLVES OF SOUTH AND CENTRAL ASIA**

My Ph.D thesis focuses on using genomics to further our knowledge on the evolutionary history of gray wolves in Asia. Gray wolves are comprised of three major mitochondrial lineages. Most gray wolves occuring from Europe to North America share recent (<100kya) maternal origins, and correspond to a Holarctic clade. The Tibetan and Indian mitochondrial lineages are deeply divergent (200-700kya) and geographicallly restricted, respectively, to the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan plateau (Figure 1). This far, no genome-wide analyses have included wolves corresponding to the mitochondrial Indian clade, and therefore it is unknown whether these wolves are genomically distinct. In 2003, Indian wolves were thought to number around 2,000 to 3,000 individuals in india and an unknown number of individuals in a declining population in Pakistan. Therefore, this genomic work has significant conservation implications for conserving the remaining Indian wolf populations. To address some of these questions, I have been collaborating with the Wildlife Institute of India for the last 7 years and starting collaborations in Pakistan over the last 3 years to investigate the genomic distinctiveness, evolutionary history, and ecology of wolves in Central and South Asia.

Wavy lines indicate the distribution of evolutionarily distinct populations within the Indian wolf (*Canis lupus pallipes*) and Tibetan wolf (*Canis lupus chanco*) based on mitochondrial analyses (<sup>1</sup>Sharma et al. 2004, <sup>2</sup>Aggarwal et al. 2007, <sup>3</sup>Esrmark et al. 2016, <sup>4</sup>Werhahn et al. 2020). 



**GENOMES, PHYLOGENETICS AND HYBRIDIZATION** 

Genealogical relationships among recently diverged lineages are often complex, involving discordance among different regions of the genome. Disentangling signals of the historical branching pattern, gene flow between lineages, and stochastic assorting of ancestral alleles of recently diverged lineages is particularly challenging. For understanding gray wolf evolutionary history, I have ultilized emerging methods to help characterize the evolution of recently diverged, yet interfertile lineages. This has involved leavaging our understanding of how phylogeny and gene flow leave distinct signatures on genomes, as well as how their distribution is influenced by recombination, to investigate historical relationships among gray wolves. This research work is currently in review at *Molecular Ecology*.

**DYNAMICS OF GENE FLOW AND SELECTION AT CONTACT ZONES IN PAKISTAN** 

More broadly, gray wolves in Asia provide a system to study the processes influencing whether and how lineage boundaries between highly mobile, yet genomically distinct populations are maintained. Based on preliminary and published mitochondrial data, the appearance of a relatively sharp contact zone between Tibetan, Indian, and Holarctic lineages is located in Pakistan and northern India (Figure 3). Whether these mitochondrial boundaries align with abrupt nuclear genomic boundaries or if widespread gene flow is occurring between wolf lineages across this mitochondrial contact zone is unknown. Over the last three years, I've been working with collaborators from NGOs and universities in Pakistan to understand wolf distribution and evolutionary history. Gray wolves are especially rare and endangered in Pakistan, and this research will provide key information for delineating populations for conservation effort. Additionally, Pakistan is centered within prominent contact zones for other mammal species, and this study will yield fundamental insights into processes that have shaped regional species diversity at this biogeographic junction of West, South, and Central Asia.
